# dotfiles

All common dotfiles used in my development environment.

These files are provided as a backup of my current environment and as an example for others to learn from. Please don't just use these configs blindly without first checking what they actually do. I take no responsibility if you manage to break something by using these files.

Configs are available for
- [Neovim](https://neovim.io/)
- [Zsh shell](https://zsh.sourceforge.io/) with [Zi](https://wiki.zshell.dev/)
