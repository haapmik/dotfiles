# dotfiles

All common dotfiles used in my [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) development environment.

These files are a backup of my current environment and can be used as an example by others. This will always be work-in-progress and constantly evolving. Please don't depend on these files or blindly use them without first checking what they actually do. I take no responsibility if you manage to break something by using these files.

Configs are available for
- [Neovim](https://neovim.io/)
- [Zsh shell](https://zsh.sourceforge.io/) with [Zi](https://wiki.zshell.dev/)
- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki)
